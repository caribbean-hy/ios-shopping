We start with Newtonian mechanics, which envisions a universal time, symmetric between past and future. This leads to the concept of a clockwork universe. We then see how developments in the 19th and 20th centuries destroy this view of time. In the 19th century, the distinction between past and future emerges from considerations of statistical processes. In the 20th century, the theory of relativity forces fundamental changes in the concept of time. Time ceases to be universal and becomes entangled with space and gravity. Quantum mechanics limits the predictability of the future and introduces verified effects so weird that Einstein wrote of them, \"No reasonable definition of reality could be expected to permit this.\"","prerequisites":"","notes":"// Some knowledge of secondary school physics useful, but not required.

We will also study the unprecedented prison-population explosion (in terms of race, gender and class), and its relationship to major social problems in American cities. Questions for consideration: How do we understand punishment? What is the relationship between race and crime? How are human rights, democracy, and family at risk?

What makes money seem so powerful and real? We will study this puzzle by exploring how various other domains-such as painting, digital media, and magic performance-make their illusions seem so compelling.

To be sure, Americans' access to food and the quality of the food they consume vary widely. But food is generally available. Whether found in supermarkets, farmer's markets, convenience stores, or restaurants of every variety, there is an abundance of food and a surfeit of choices. How did this come to be? How did high-yield agriculture develop? How did processed foods find their way to store shelves? To illuminate these questions and more, we will examine the history, technology, and politics of agricultural production throughout the twentieth century. We will also consider contemporary food production practices and ethical dilemmas about how food is produced.

It will, in particular, study the concept of obligation in the ritual and other parts of the fiqh. It will also draw attention to the fact that the ritual has always been and continues to be one of the most important forms in which Islamic Law is present in Muslim societies.","prerequisites":"","notes":"Offered jointly with the Divinity School as 3584.","meetings":"M 4-6 ","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"5565","term":"FALL","bracketed":true,"field":"SCI-PHYUNV","number":"28","title":"Invisible Worlds","faculty":"2cad8e6e404ab4062b2845d6509fcfc2,d1a57eaebcba23cb3664576b45d07c53","description":"What we perceive as \"reality\" is the best effort of our senses to interpret a deeper, largely invisible, reality that is unnervingly strange.

Micro- and nanostructures are the basis both of fundamentally new science, and of ubiquitous technologies: quantum dots, computers, the biological nanomotors that power muscle, buckyballs, tools for examining single mammalian cells, lasers. The course will describe these objects and how they function; it will also touch on issues of commercialization, economics, public policy, and ethics that spring from the avalanche of discovery and invention in this area.","prerequisites":"","notes":"This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the Core area requirement for Science A.","meetings":"M 10 W 10 F 10 ","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"5567","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"PSY","number":"993","title":"Senior Tutorial: Honors Thesis (Social and Cognitive Neuroscience)","faculty":"915b0ed348ff3b904d5fa0f461ab8f26","description":"Individual supervised research supplemented with occasional group meetings to discuss major aspects of the thesis process (e.g., organizing, conducting, and presenting research).

In this course we develop an understanding of these natural hazards from an earth science perspective, and examine several case studies to assess their catastrophic impacts. Given our scientific understanding of these phenomena, we examine ways to assess and forecast future natural disasters, and to mitigate the adverse impacts to our societies.

What factors have determined which countries prosper? Which are the root causes and which are the proximate causes of economic underdevelopment? Can these factors be changed with specific economic policies? If so, what are they and how are they best implemented? Are there country-specific characteristics that determine economic fate? Or, is prosperity just the result of luck? Does the enjoyment of the rich somehow depend on the continuing suffering of the poor? We will consider these questions and more. The course is intended to not only provide a general overview of the dominant views about economic development and policy, but to also provide students a sense of the most recent research in the field. For this reason, the course will go beyond the usual textbook summary of the field.

In exploring literature about three kinds of cross-cultural encounters-transient, colonial/postcolonial, and immigrant-we'll pose such resonant questions.","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"M 12 W 12 ","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"81727","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"CELLBIO","number":"387","title":"Calcium signaling in health and disease","faculty":"f6724a7747d6358b5fe49225d2cc87b9","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"81727","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"CELLBIO","number":"387","title":"Calcium signaling in health and disease","faculty":"f6724a7747d6358b5fe49225d2cc87b9","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"8173","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"ENG-SCI","number":"335","title":"Mechanics of Engineering Materials and Small Devices","faculty":"a14f57b6773a73bf5c8bfe7c5e97d88c","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"8173","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"ENG-SCI","number":"335","title":"Mechanics of Engineering Materials and Small Devices","faculty":"a14f57b6773a73bf5c8bfe7c5e97d88c","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"81745","term":"FALL","bracketed":true,"field":"COMPSCI","number":"203hf","title":"A Better Internet: Policy and Practice","faculty":"5aece5c57c2169c10a3b79ed6fea9526","description":"Students will propose ideas for a better Internet, test them with stakeholders, prototype them for industries and organizations, and attack difficult implementation problems in a problem-solving capstone.","prerequisites":"","notes":"Half course through the year, meeting in January at Stanford University.

Yet, it has not always been the easiest topic for public discussion. Outside of the classroom much of what we know, or think about slavery derives often from popular media - particularly through film and television. Classics like Gone with the Wind, the television miniseries Roots, and even lesser known films such as Langston Hughes' (screenwriter) Way Down South have done much to shape our perspective regarding how we remember and understand the slave system, the enslaved, its participants and politics. This course poses the following questions: Can Hollywood do the work of the historian? Does historical interpretation through film serve as useful, beneficial, or detrimental? How so? Can we make an argument for the historical efficacy of films?

We will examine the philosophical justification of these values as a background to the discussion of the applied cases mentioned above.","prerequisites":"","notes":"Open to Freshmen only.","meetings":"M 2-4 ","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"96003","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"DRB","number":"316","title":"Stem Cells and Organ Size Control","faculty":"2f726d6b03d3a327dac8df63064e4810","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"96003","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"DRB","number":"316","title":"Stem Cells and Organ Size Control","faculty":"2f726d6b03d3a327dac8df63064e4810","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"9601","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"BCMP","number":"382","title":"Mechanisms of RNAi in Stem Cells","faculty":"8efed77ff41841650f06c680b3b7431d","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"9601","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"BCMP","number":"382","title":"Mechanisms of RNAi in Stem Cells","faculty":"8efed77ff41841650f06c680b3b7431d","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"9602","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"HEB","number":"3310","title":"Experimental Methods","faculty":"","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"9602","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"HEB","number":"3310","title":"Experimental Methods","faculty":"","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"96032","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"EXPOS","number":"20.102","title":"The Voice of Authority","faculty":"85071aa36ff9ab8a8aa3913c43763e9e","description":"What is authority?

This course explores points of contact between evolutionary genetics and Buddhism, centering on the notion of \"emptiness,\" and building knowledge of each so that ethical questions about animals in research, genetic testing, and human genetic engineering can be discussed.","prerequisites":"","notes":"Open to Freshmen only.","meetings":"M 3-5 ","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"9796","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"PSY","number":"2450","title":"Affective and Social Neuroscience","faculty":"78e62e40d42631038863656814d044de","description":"Reviews two emerging fields in neuroscience, affective and social neuroscience.
